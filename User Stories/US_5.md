As a team member, I would like to be able to have my own data(progress).

1. As a team member, I would like to be able to view my own dashboard so I know what other people can see about me.
2. As a team member, I would like to be able to view relevant files assigned to me so that I can see those files.
3. As a team member, I would like to be able to alter my own assigned files and resubmit my files so that I can continue to update my files as needed.
4. As a team member, I would like to be able to view the statistics of my data so that I have an understanding of my progress as a team member.
5. As a team member, I would like to be able to see the history of the files/tasks assigned to me so that I have proof of my progress in projects.
6. As a team member, I would like to be able to view the chat-rooms I can join so that I know what groups I can contact.
