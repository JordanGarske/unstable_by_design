As a team member, I want to be able to see different versions of my code

1. As a team member, I would like to be able to have different versions of codes active parallel to each other so that other team members can work at the same time.
2. As a team member, I would like to be able to delete different versions so that I can keep the version tree simple.
3. As a team member, I would like to be able to view different versions of my managers and team mates so that I know what other team members are working on.
4. As a team member, I would like to be able to add tasks to a specific version so that others know what needs to be added to that specific version.
