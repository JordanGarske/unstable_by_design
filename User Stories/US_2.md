As a team member, I would like to view tasks

1. As a team member, I would like to be able to review completed tasks so that I know what has been completed.
2. As a team member, I want to see tasks that are assigned to me in a project so that I can complete what is needed of me first.
3. As a team member, I want to see tasks assigned to other team members so that I know who is working on what task.
4. As a team member, I want to filter tasks so that I can see what I want to see and not have a lot of clutter in my way.
5. As a team member, I would like to be able to mark tasks as "not started," "in progress," "complete," and "more info needed" so that I can passively inform other team members of the progress of the task.
