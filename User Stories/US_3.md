As a manager, I would like to be able to organize my team

1. As a manager, I would like to create specific channels/threads so that I can organize conversations to reflect what is being discussed.
2. As a manager, I would like to assign tasks to team members so that I can ensure members complete specific tasks.
3. As a manager, I would like to prioritize tasks so that the team members know what needs to be completed first.
4. As a manager, I would like to add/remove team members to my team so that I can have everyone I want working on the specific project.
5. As a manager, I want to create sub-groups so that each group can work together on select tasks.
6. As a manager, I want to view progress of team members on a task so that I know the team is making progress towards the goal.
